The cattle or ‘maatu’ is worshipped on the Maatu Pongal day. People show their veneration to the work they do on the farmlands.

The overflow of the milk is seen as a symbol of prosperity and abundance. People celebrate this moment by shouting ‘Pongalo Pongal’. Sugarcane, vegetables, and spices are also offered to God. It is believed that unmarried girls observe penance as they pray for the agricultural prosperity of the country. They take bath early in the morning and do not consume milk or other dairy products. The festival is also celebrated in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Puducherry. It is also celebrated among the Tamil diaspora across the world, especially in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore.
